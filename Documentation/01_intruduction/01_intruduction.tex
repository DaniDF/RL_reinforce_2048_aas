The release of the 2048 game in 2014 sparked a surge in popularity among players and research interest in building the best AI-based agent for the game.
The AI-based agents discussed in the dissertation are policy gradient agents with baselines. These agents select an action at each step by maximizing the expected return. The baseline is an estimate of the expected return for a given state, and it is used to reduce variance in the policy gradient updates. The dissertation explores different approaches to training policy gradient agents, with the goal of training the best possible agent for playing 2048.
In the subsequent sections, we will introduce the rules of the 2048 game. We will then present other AI-based solutions that have been proposed for the game. Next, we will describe the architecture of the proposed networks. Finally, we will present the collected results from the training of the networks.
