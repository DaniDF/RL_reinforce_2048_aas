The stochastic nature of the 2048 game poses a challenge for the development of AI-based agents. This dissertation proposes two neural network architectures that employ distinct networks to address this challenge. Using played board configurations as initial state helps to improve the performances of the training. While the goal of reaching the tile 2048 was not achieved, the played board configurations have proven to be a valid help during the training.
