2048\cite{2048} is a single-player, deterministic, turn-based, sliding puzzle video game developed by Gabriele Cirulli and released in 2014. The game was originally written in JavaScript and later ported to Android and iOS.
The game 2048 is played on a 4x4 grid of cells. At the beginning of the game, the grid is initialized with two non-empty cells. At the beginning of the game, two tiles are randomly placed on the grid with values between 2 and 4. At each step, the player can choose one of four moves: \textit{LEFT}, \textit{UP}, \textit{RIGHT}, or \textit{DOWN}. After a move is played, all tiles are translated in the direction of the action without any intervening spaces between tiles. If two tiles with the same value are adjacent after the translation, they are merged into a single tile with the sum of their values. The game score is then incremented by the value of the new tile.
After the player has completed their move, the game randomly adds a new tile to the board. The game then continues. The game stops when there are no tiles that can be merged and no empty spaces on the board.
The goal of the game is to reach the tile with a value of 2048 on the board. After reaching the 2048 tile, the game does not terminate and allows players to continue to merge tiles and increase the value of the tiles. The maximum tile value is $131072$, which is equal to $2^{17}$. The number of legal board configurations is $18^{16}$.
